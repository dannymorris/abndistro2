## Overview

GluonTS is a deep learning-based framework for probabilisitc time series modeling and forecasting. As mentioned in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05264.pdf), deep learning models improve upon traditional univariate models (e.g. Arima) with their ability to train a single, global model over an entire collection of time series. 

## Takeaways from my experiment

- Using a simple [feedforward MLP](https://ts.gluon.ai/api/gluonts/gluonts.model.simple_feedforward.html) neural network, training and inference for 152 time series (each with 441 time steps) required about 7 seconds in total.

- The API is generally simple, though the documentation needs work.

- Probabilistic forecast intervals combined with deep learning make GluonTS highly appealing.

- Based on the use case documented in the notebook, impressive predictive accuracy appears attainable using the simple feedforward MLP with default model parameters.
