      <description>Overview I recently participated in the M5 Forecasting - Accuracy Kaggle competition to forecast daily sales for over 30,000 WalMart products. I had some initial struggles processing the data and training models in-memory, so I eventually turned to running distributed training jobs using AWS SageMaker.
This post outlines the basic steps required to run a distributed machine learning job on AWS using the SageMaker SDK in Python. The steps are broken down into the following:</description>

      <description>This post briefly describes how I built an object detection model using AWS SageMaker and GluonCV to detect Blue Cross Blue Shield logos. Full code and notebooks can be found in the GitHub repo.
Collecting and preparing training images To collect images for training, I searched Google for &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshied logo&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield letter&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield building&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield shirt&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield event&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield shirt&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield bus&amp;rdquo;. I ended up with 400 images for training and validation.</description>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
