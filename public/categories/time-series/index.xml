Overview GluonTS is a deep learning-based framework for probabilisitc time series modeling and forecasting. As mentioned in the paper, deep learning models improve upon traditional univariate models (e.g.Â Arima) with their ability to train a single, global model over an entire collection of time series.
 Takeaways from my experience getting started  Training and inference for all 152 time series required about 2 minutes in total using the DeepAR estimator and CPUs provided by Google Colab.</description>
