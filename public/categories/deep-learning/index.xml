      <description>Overview Notebook Pseudocode Takeaways from my experience getting started   Overview GluonTS is a deep learning-based framework for probabilisitc time series modeling and forecasting. As mentioned in the paper, deep learning models improve upon traditional univariate models (e.g.Â Arima) with their ability to train a single, global model over an entire collection of time series.
 Notebook The use case shown in this notebook involves jointly training and forecasting 152 time series at monthly intervals.</description>

      <description>This post briefly describes how I built an object detection model using AWS SageMaker and GluonCV to detect Blue Cross Blue Shield logos. Full code and notebooks can be found in the GitHub repo.
Collecting and preparing training images To collect images for training, I searched Google for &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshied logo&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield letter&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield building&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield shirt&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield event&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield shirt&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;bluecross blueshield bus&amp;rdquo;. I ended up with 400 images for training and validation.</description>
