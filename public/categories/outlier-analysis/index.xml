      <description>Overview A little bit about ensembling Defining the strategy Testing the strategy Pseudocode for training and testing Pseudocode for cross validation Pseudocode for production   Overview This post demonstrates a strategy for rare class learning whereby out-of-sample predictions are made using data-centric ensembling. This strategy is described by Charu Aggarwal in section 7.2 of his book Outlier Analysis. This is an excellent book that presents a ton of interesting material on statistics and modeling in a very readable way.</description>
